RBM is a stochastic neural network that has many different applications, such
as dimensionality reduction, classification, collaborative filtering, feature
learning and topic modeling. The neural network has visible units and hidden
units, where each of the hidden units is connected with each of the visible
units. The usage of this network depends on the application.SD-VBS utilizes
RBM to implement movie suggestion (collaborative filtering) on a reduced
Netflix database. SD-VBS provides the benchmark for the training process of
RBM, not the recommendation process. We are interested in the training process
because it is very computationally intensive. It can take hours or days to
complete depending on the size of the database. For this reason, we reduced the
size of Netflix database (without loss of generality) to make the running time
of the benchmark feasible. To train RBM, we need a data comprising of users and
their movie ratings. We initialize the RBM with “random” parameters. Then, we
repeat the training iteration until convergence. In every iteration, we let the
current RBM try to reconstruct the input data, and then we adjust its
parameters based on the error of the data reconstruction. With more iterations,
the reconstruction error diminishes, and we stop the training when the error
converges (or until some predetermined number of iterations is reached). These
iterations are very computationally intensive.
